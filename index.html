      <p>
        Hello, it's nice to e-meet you. I have been learning how to code since
        last year. I have been taking these courses with the goal of building my
        personal portfolio. In this economy, I rather learn the skills necessary
        to build my projects that accurately reflect my vision than to pay a
        monthly subscription for a service that is limited in features. I hope
        to continue my learning and be able to build websites. Stayed tuned for
        the journey to come!
